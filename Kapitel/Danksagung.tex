Suter for PMR geometries. 

Horizon 2020 MSCA and MPI for funding. 

I would like to thank the following people for their various contributions to this body of work:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Dr. Ryszard Narkowicz was involved in the design and optimization of the SRR geometries. 
    \item Anatoly Firsov fabricated the the SRRs geometries using an electron microscope at Helmholtz-Zentrum Berlin. 
    \item Within the group of Prof. Thomas Happe, Drs. Jifu Duan and Martin Winkler grew [FeFe]-hydrogenase crystals from {\em Clostridium pasteurianum} (CpI) in the H$_{ox}$ state.
    \item Prof. Athina Zouni and Dr. Rana Hussein for growing the photosystem II crystals from {\em Thermosynechococcus elongatus}. 
    \item We gratefully acknowledge the skillful manufacturing of the resonator assembly by of Stephan Syring and Udo Klar at the Max Planck Institute for Chemical Energy Conversion and Sebastian Planckert at Max Planck Institute for Kohlenforschung.
    \item Dr. Karsten Holldack for performing the FD-FT THz experiments.
    \item Illuminau for Sapphire geometries.
    \item Dr. M. Chrysina from the Max Planck Institute for Chemical Energy Conversion for guidance on photosystem II spectra.
    \item M. Reus for the photosystem II BBY prepared sample and the UV-VIS measurements used in this work. 
\end{itemize}

Of course, none of this would be possible without the support of my family. I give my undying gratitude to my wife, Emily, who has kept me grounded while providing a loving home. And to my daughter, Juniper, who's smile and curiosity inspires me to push further.
