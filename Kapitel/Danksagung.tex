\abstrakt{Acknowledgements}

This work could not have been realized without the many people who have given me their support, mentorship, and guidance through this process. I would first like to thank Prof. Wolfgang Lubitz for his mentorship and invitation to the Max Planck Institute for Chemical Energy Conversion. This opportunity has been personally and professionally stimulating. I would like to thank Prof. Dieter Suter for being my promoter at TU Dortmund. This has been a very fruitful collaboration and I look forward to working together in the future. I thank Dr. Edward J. Reijerse for his supervision and discussion. His input to this work has been invaluable. Finally, I would like to thank Dr. Alexander Schnegg for his mentorship and the EPR Research Group for countless discussions. 

This work has been funded by the Horizon 2020 Marie Sk\l{}odowska-Curie Actions Fellowship (ActEPR; Grant No. 745702) and Max Planck Institute. 

I would like to thank the following people for their various contributions to this body of work:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Chapter 3: 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item We gratefully acknowledge the skillful manufacturing of Stephan Syring and Udo Klar at the Max Planck Institute for Chemical Energy Conversion and Sebastian Planckert at Max Planck Institute for Kohlenforschung.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Chapter 4:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Dr. Ryszard Narkowicz was involved in the design and optimization of the SRR geometries. 
        \item Anatoly Firsov fabricated the the SRRs geometry using an electron microscope at Helmholtz-Zentrum Berlin. 
        \item Drs. Joscha Nehrkorn and Karsten Holldack for performing the FD-FT THz experiments.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Chapters 5 and 6:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Within the group of Prof. Thomas Happe, Drs. Jifu Duan and Martin Winkler grew [FeFe]-hydrogenase crystals from {\em Clostridium pasteurianum} (CpI) in the H$_{ox}$ state.
        \item Within the group of Prof. Athina Zouni, Dr. Rana Hussein grew the photosystem II complex crystals from {\em Thermosynechococcus elongatus}. 
        \item Dr. M. Chrysina from the Max Planck Institute for Chemical Energy Conversion for guidance on photosystem II spectra.
        \item M. Reus for the photosystem II BBY prepared sample and the UV-VIS measurements.     
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

Of course, none of this would be possible without the support of my family. I give my undying gratitude to my wife, Emily, who has kept me grounded while providing a loving home. And to my daughter, Juniper, who's smile and curiosity inspires me to push further.
