\section*{Contributions}
Dr. Ryszard Narkowicz was involved in the design and optimization of the SRR geometries. Anatoly Firsov fabricated the the SRRs geometries using an electron microscope at Helmholtz-Zentrum Berlin. Drs. Karsten Holldack, Joscha Nehrkorn and Alexander Schnegg performed all of the experiments. Jason W. Sidabras analyzed the measured data and constructed the lumped-circuit transmission\-/line model and wrote the manuscript. All simulations of the SRR were repeated for this work by Jason W. Sidabras. Prof. Dieter Suter and Dr. Alexander Schnegg conceived of the project and were integral in the discussion of this work.


\section*{Contributions} Jason W. Sidabras, Dr. Edward Reijerse, and Prof. Wolfgang Lubitz conceived the project. Jason W. Sidabras conceived, designed, optimized, and fabricated the self-resonant micro-helix, performed the characterization measurements, prepared all crystals for EPR experiments, and analyzed the data. Within the group of Prof. Athina Zouni, Dr. Rana Hussein grew the photosystem II crystals from {\em Thermosynechococcus elongatus}. Drs. Reijerse, Dieter Suter, and Alexander Schnegg were integral in the discussion. 


\section*{Contributions} Jason W. Sidabras, Dr. Edward Reijerse, and Prof. Wolfgang Lubitz conceived the project. Jason W. Sidabras prepared all crystals for EPR experiments, performed the measurements, and analyzed the data. Within the group of Prof. Thomas Happe, Drs. Jifu Duan and Martin Winkler grew [FeFe]-hydrogenase crystals from {\em Clostridium pasteurianum} (CpI) in the H$_{ox}$ state. Dr. Reijerse was integral in setting up the EPR experiments and the discussion of the analyzed data. 


\section*{Contributions}
Jason W. Sidabras was intimately involved in the concept, design, optimization, and testing of the re-entrant TE$_{01\text{U}}$ resonator for Q-band. Dr. Edward Reijerse helped perform the the nutation experiments and asked fundamental questions that led to Fig.~\ref{Ch2-fig:waveguide}B and Fig.~\ref{Ch2-fig:coupling}. Dr. Reijerse and Prof. Wolfgang were integral in the discussion of potential applications of the resonator design.
