\chapter[Preliminary ESEEM Data of Hox.]{Preliminary $^{14}$N Three-Pulse ESEEM Data of H$_{ox}$ from CpI.}

The following three-pulse ESEEM data was taken by following the fusca-colored resonance roadmap of Fig.~\ref{fig:xTalFeFe}A in Chapter 6. Herein, the $\tau$ is 280~ns, $t_1$ starts at 300~ns with 256 24~ns steps, and $\pi$-pulse is 80~ns at a microwave power of 7~mW. A total of 16 $\tau$ values are taken
