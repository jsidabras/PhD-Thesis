\chapter[Second Hox data set]{Second Hox data set}

In order to increase confidence in the $g$-tensor solution of Table~6.1 an additional rotation set in two planes was performed on the same crystal. The crystal was removed from the resonator and rotated arbitrarily within the micro-helix to obtain the secondary dataset. The data was then fit assuming the rotation was only around the L$_3$ axis.
